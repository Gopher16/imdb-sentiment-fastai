for thinking adults. this script suggests a beginning as a live - action movie, that struck someone as the type of crap you can not sell to adults anymore. the \" crack staff \" of many older adventure movies has been done well before, ( think the dirty dozen ) but represents one of the worse films in that motif. the characters are weak. even the background that each member trots out seems stock and awkward at best. an md / medicine man, a tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted sons, if we have not at least seen these before, we have seen mix - and - match quirks before. the story about how one companion, vinny played by don novello ( fr. guido sarducci ), went from flower stores to demolitions totally unconvincing. only the main character, milo thatch, a young atlantis - obsessed academic voiced by michael j. fox, has any depth to him. milo 's search for atlantis continues that of his grandfather who raised him. the opening scene shows a much younger milo giddily perched on a knee, as his grandfather places his pith helmet on his head. and while the characters were thin at best, the best part about was the voice talent. commander rourke loses nothing being voiced by james garner. although rourke is a pretty stock military type, garner shows his ability to breath life into characters simply by his delivery. garner 's vocal performance is the high point. i 'm sorry to say leonard nimoy 's dying king is nothing more than obligatory. additionally, don novello as the demolition expert, vinny, was also notable for one or two well - done, funny lines -- but i 've always liked father guido sarducci, anyway. also well done was the computer animation. the background animation, that is. the character animation does nothing if not make already flat characters appear even flatter. aside from landscapes, buildings and vehicles there is n't much to impress. the plot was the worst. some say hackneyed or trite. i 'm not so sure about that. any serviceable plot can be made into something new with the proper treatment. shakespeare often started from a known story and plot and was famous only for putting on a new coat of paint. so the treatment is the thing. and obviously lacks that. i can not begin to go into all the logic gaps without a spoiler section. the plot was bad. the plot 's bridges snap like twine and the ending does not make sense. to add to that, the script and the animation is peppered with annoying sloppiness. * * spoilers * * right at the beginning when milo reveals that runic or celtic symbols have been wrongly and the \" coast of ireland \" should read the \" coast of iceland \", we begin to have problems. the writers of the script would need to know the british take for or as \" ireland \", and completely ignore the older, latin term. but more than this, they need to know of the vikings conspiracy to call the greener island iceland and the island greenland. by making it the matter of a mis - \" letter \", the writers have doomed themselves to requiring a runic version of english and a post - roman date on the script. since this is long after atlantis was supposed to have sunk into its undersea cave. and without visible clues and less technology than milo had, made the inscription far less trustworthy. the shepherd 's journal could not be written before the sinking of atlantis, or it would know nothing about the cave or the crystal lying \" in the king 's eye \". it must have been written after the sinking, but without even the technology that milo 's expedition had, how the heck did anybody get by the leviathan. so how could it know more about anything after that? and why would it be written in atlantian? automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things. however clairvoyance and astral travel do not require to write in atlantian. so it 's got to be some sort automatic writing. since no - one left in atlantis can read, it must be the spirits of the crystal beaming messages to the surface. this would have made more sense. but could also have been explained within the movie: milo could shepherd have discovered that this power had been calling him all his life -- appeared in dreams, etc. this needed to be explored in the movie. the atlantians should simply not be able to comprehend modern languages. no - one expects that the original indo - europeans would be able to converse in europe, anymore than romans would understand that hard \" or their day became french \" ( pronounced like \", no less! ) current atlantians were alive before the cataclysm -- when apparently they * could * read, yet now are unable to read what they used to, or operate similar machinery. the mass illiteracy points out a crucial flaw in the movie. nothing seems to have happened to this culture. it seems suspended in air until milo can rescue it. even though it appears that life is not a constant struggle for survival, no - one wants to compose poetry or write novels and perhaps it is a combination of atlantian school systems going downhill toward the end and lack of good fiction that caused atlantis to fall into illiteracy. kida can be excused for not knowing how to read or operate the machinery if she was so young when the cataclysm of stupidity set in -- but any of it * * hardly * * qualifies her father for!! kashakim 's foolishness almost single - handedly wiped his people from existence. killed a bunch in the cataclysm, stalled progress ( not a lot killed here, but he oversaw a massive slide in culture and progress ) until someone could take the crystal to kill everybody, if they were n't boiled in lava first because the giant robots were n't there to protect them. a bolt of blue electricity should have shattered kashakim 's likeness, when kida tried joining her father 's image to the circle of great kings of atlantis! even though milo was the only one who could read atlantian, rourke and others knew enough to look through a book of gibberish and find a page on a crystal -- which he knew to be a crystal and not some stylized astrological or \" phases of the sun \" diagram. if milo 's grandfather had told rourke about it, it still does not explain how rourke would have suffered from milo 's reading it as part of the book. ripping out the page -- which was dog - eared in rourke 's hand, even though milo found no sign of a torn page in the book apparently -- only was there to tip off the viewer that \" something was not quite right \". unless the word \" crystal \" would have set alarms off in milo 's head that somebody would try to steal it, milo would have suspected nothing. it 's just thick - headed foreshadowing. the crew 's \" double - cross \" was not a character change. we learned that vinny, sweet, audrey and cookie had been going along with rourke from the beginning. however, the \" change of heart \" falls flat. it was a change, and needed to be better motivated. hard to do with characters who were n't given anything to begin with. niggling little bit that the lava flows up over the dome, instead of filling in the rest of the area that we view the sequence from. it 's liquid; it will not flow over the protective dome until it fills up all lower areas. the ending and makes no sense other than to appease political correctness. with it 's restored, atlantis is no longer a weak power, needing coddling. the giant robot guardians and the sky - cycles shooting blue lightning suggest that they have less to fear from us than they might. the technology is superior to ours, and definitely to early 20th - century. in the end milo needs to teach the atlantians to read, for what? the whole idea is to leave their little quiet, chastened culture alone, not to send it into. * * end spoilers * * perhaps, the lost world plot and the turn - of - the - century setting should give me a hint that this is more an homage to pulps. the failures i find with the film agree with this idea. but i am at a loss why i should pay to see thin characters and plot holes simply because many dime novels had them as well. and pulp stories is part of the \" crap they ca n't sell adults anymore \", anyway. we have become a bit more sophisticated and our pulp needs to grow up as well. raiders of the lost ark lost none of its pulp feel and avoided so much badness. 4 out of 10 - -the movie is enjoyable but as i think about the plot, it seeps ever lower.\n\n[2] pos:\nwarning: does contain spoilers. open your eyes if you have not seen this film and plan on doing so, just stop reading here and take my word for it. you have to see this film. i have seen it four times so far and i still have n't made up my mind as to what exactly happened in the film. that is all i am going to say because if you have not seen this film, then stop reading right now. if you are still reading then i am going to pose some questions to you and maybe if anyone has any answers you can email me and let me know what you think. i remember my grade 11 english teacher quite well. his name was mr.. to me, he was wise beyond his years and he always had this way of teaching you things that perhaps you were n't all too keen on. if we did n't like shakespeare, then he turned the story into a modern day romance with modern day language so we could understand it. our class room was never a room, it was a cottage and we were on the lake reading a book at our own leisure time. this was his own indelible way of branding something into our sponge - like minds. i begin this review of vanilla sky with a description of this brilliant man because he once gave us an assignment that has been firmly etched in my mind, like the phone number of a long lost best friend, and it finally made some sense to me after watching the matrix. now if i did n't know better, i would have thought that the wachowski brothers were really just an alias for my teacher mr.. but giving them the benefit of the doubt, we 'll assume it was n't him. but that was the first time this assignment was anything more than. he had asked us to prove to him and to ourselves that were real. show me how you can tell that you are real. this got the class spouting off all of the usual ideas that i 'm sure you can imagine. everything from pain, to sense of touch to sense of loss to sense of hunger were spouted off to our teacher to prove to him that we were real. after every scenario that we gave him, he would come back with the one answer that would leave us speechless. \" what if you are nothing but someone else 's dream? \" what if you were someone else 's dream? what a messed up question that is. this was a question / scenario posed to us about 15 years ago, before the astronomical use of the internet and rapid advancement of computers. how possible could it seem back then? but if you look at today 's technology, now ask yourself, what it you were a part of someone else 's dream. another brilliant but surreal film this year, david lynch 's mulholland drive explored similar areas. but vanilla sky goes deeper than any other film could hope to. in short this is one film that will literally ( if you let it ) blow your mind from all of the possibilities that surround you. open your eyes. tom cruise plays david aames, a young, hot shot, righteous, full of himself publisher and owner of several magazines. he inherited this from his father and although he has talent and business savvy, his board of, the seven dwarfs, think he is a rich dink born with a silver spoon in his mouth. they feel he has done nothing to deserve the pinnacle of success that each and every one of them believes should go to them. early in the film we meet one of david 's gorgeous toys named julie gianni, played with pernicious but bombastic perfection by cameron diaz. david and julie play a good game, both claiming they are just there to use each other and are not the slightest bit interested in a monogamous, committed relationship. this is the type of relationship commensurate with david 's other flings he 's had in the sexual prime of his life. and although both talk a good game, we can tell that only one is really telling the truth. next we meet brian shelby, played with a stroke of genius by kevin smith 's good buddy jason lee. brian is writing a book that david is going to publish but they are also very good friends. this is something that david has very little of in his life and you can sense a real caring for one another early on in the film. brian has one famous line that he keeps telling david over and over again. and that is \" the sweet ai n't so sweet without the bitter. \" he goes on to tell him that one day he will find true love and not just this part time lover status that he seems to perpetrate with all of the floozies who inhabit his bed for a night or two. at david 's huge birthday bash, ( so huge that the likes of steven spielberg wish him a happy birthday ) brian enters with his date, sofia, played of course by penelope cruz with what has to be the best performance of this year by an actress. this is a bash by invite only and at first david and sofia seem intrigued with one another. and in typical david fashion, despite his best friend being there, he begins to flirt with sofia. to complicate things, julie shows up uninvited and begins spying on david. david then spends the night with sofia, but they only talk and draw caricatures of one another. there is no hanky panky. the next day, as david is leaving sofia 's apartment, he is greeted by julie, who offers him a ride and from there … ….well, i think we have all seen the commercials. that is all i will really say about the plot, because from here the film teases us with what is reality and what is blurred perception. we are introduced to a character played by kurt russel and a few other shady characters that all play a part in this labyrinth like haze. there is a subtext of death and possible panacea - like cure - alls that may or not be able to create the possibility of eternal life. this is just one of the intriguing possibilities the movie offers us, but it does n't end there. like many movies seem to thrive on today, this film has a secret. sixth sense may have began this craze, but look even further back and you can maybe thank angel heart for starting the craze. regardless of how it originated, vanilla sky has one of it 's own gut busters. and what makes this one so much fun is that the film gives you many obvious clues along the way but not enough to give you an solution to the gauntlet of truth and lies you have just put yourself through. i have seen this film four times and every time it has been because i want to see if there is something more i can pick up, something more i can understand. to be able to work your mind in the theater, to enable it to open up to new possibilities is something rare in a film. all of the ersatz so called \" best pictures of the year \" have been good but nothing spectacular. they lack substance. a beautiful mind was intriguing but flat, the royal tenenbaums was interesting but uneven. vanilla sky is a rarity because it is a film that leaves you yearning for more yet guarantees your satisfaction because the film and those that made it care about it. i know this film has received mixed reviews but i just think that those who do n't like it do n't quite understand it. this is what film making is supposed to be like. this is what a film is supposed to do to you. it is supposed to make you feel something. most of the other films this year have been just empty spaces. this one is n't. 10 out of 10 the best film of the year. i would love to see this get nominated for best picture and i would love to see cruz up for best actress, diaz for best supporting, cruise for best actor and jason mewes should be a shoe in for best supporting actor. cameron crowe should there as well. none of this may come to pass, and that is a shame. this is one film that should not be missed. and on a final note, i am quite sure mr. would like this film and maybe this is the one film that may answer his question. can you prove you are real? or are we just a figment of someone 's imagination? are we artificially transplanted for someone else 's bemusement? this is a film that spawns more questions than it does answers. and i 'm sure that is just fine with him. open your eyes\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":7},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\n\nlearn =
